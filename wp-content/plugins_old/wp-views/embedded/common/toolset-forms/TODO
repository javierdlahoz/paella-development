- Enable rendering just fields (without form headers)

- Added $value to field constructor



Remarks on WPToolset_Field_Textfield (field class)
Too loose adding field properties.
Too much processing in construct.
Is all necessary?
Can we add only methods and variables that we're absolutely sure that are needed?
For me it makes harder to follow whole thing.

Remarks on config class
Has same methods as abstract field.
Looks to me like double job.
Do we need both?
For me it makes harder to follow whole thing.

wpv_condition works only with post meta.
We need to make it work with various data (passed e.g. usermeta etc).

Repetitive fields should not be used as conditional triggers.
Config for field is passed but not for triggers.
How to determine if trigger is repetitive?

field::metaform()
Is where all handling is processed. Since it is used by Types only for now,
it was easier for me to implement it there.
I do not know where and how to implement when whole form is rendered.


Types

Srdjan
I tried to add only things I know are absolutely necessary.

Simple fields

Textfield
Textarea
Email
Numeric
Phone
URL
Embed

Rest of fields

Audio
Colorpicker
Video

Date
Date requires it's own library encapsulated.
Similar like image resizing and image utilities.

File
Image
Similar type, requires adjustments.
Image extends File.
File needs library encapsulated.


Skype
Opens popup. Has array as value.

Checkbox
Needs checking if submitted or not. Using single fields needs manual check.

Checkboxes
Radio
Select
Fields with options.

WYSIWYG
WP editor. Code works fine with WP 3.4 - 3.8 but consider updating.





JS Caching
We need caching JS. I think Bruce and Riccardo have caching library.
